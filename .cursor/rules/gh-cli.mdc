- Use the [GitHub CLI manual](mdc:https:/cli.github.com/manual) as the reference for all CLI-based GitHub operations.
- Prefer using `gh` commands over manual API calls for scripting and automation tasks.
- Ensure correct syntax, flags, and authentication behavior based on the docs.
- Apply recommended patterns for issues, PRs, repos, workflows, etc.
