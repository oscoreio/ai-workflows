- Use the [Octokit REST.js v21 docs](mdc:https:/octokit.github.io/rest.js/v21) for any GitHub API operations.
- Prefer `github.rest.*` over raw HTTP or custom wrappers.
- Reference specific `reactions`, `issues`, `pulls`, `comments` methods based on your usage in workflows.
- Follow pagination, authentication, and error handling recommendations from the docs.
