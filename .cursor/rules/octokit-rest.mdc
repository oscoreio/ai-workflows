- Use the [Octokit REST.js v21 documentation](mdc:https:/octokit.github.io/rest.js/v21) as the primary reference for all GitHub API calls.
- Prefer Octokit client methods over raw fetch/axios.
- Follow the documented input/output shapes for every method.
- Handle pagination, previews, and authentication as described in the docs.
